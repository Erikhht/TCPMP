NOTE: the following files are copied from the ../test_libFLAC directory:

	file_utils.c
	file_utils.h
	metadata_utils.c
	metadata_utils.h

It's too much of a pain to make a convenience library for these and CVS
can't do soft links, so we put up with having two copies of these sources.

metadata_utils.c and metadata_utils.h have trivial changes for use in this
package.
