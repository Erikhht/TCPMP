FFMPEG plugin for The Core Pocket Media Player

FFmpeg plugin is just a subset of the original FFmpeg open-source library. Still it's robust, mostly slower as other ARM optimized decoders and needs more memory. Supports MPEG1/2, MPEG4 (with GMC/QPEL), h.263, MS-MPEG4-v1/v2/v3, Sorenson 3, WMV7/8 and AVC (aka h.264).

ATTENTION: Not all features of WMV8 is supported. Plugin can crash with some WMV8 files.
