Getting source code
-------------------

If you want to compile an official release of ASAP, get the source distribution
("asap-*.tar.gz") and uncompress it to a directory of your choice.
On Unix-like systems:
tar zxf asap-*.tar.gz
On Windows you may use 7-Zip.
Source distributions of ASAP include the part of Atari800 emulator sources
used by ASAP (POKEY and 6502 emulation).

If you instead want to compile the latest version from the CVS, checkout
the "asap" module of the "asap" project and the "atari800" module
of the "atari800" project into the same directory (so it contains
the subdirectories "asap" and "atari800" after the checkouts).
Using a command-line CVS client:
mkdir asap-cvs
cd asap-cvs
cvs -z9 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/asap co -P asap
cvs -z9 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/atari800 co -P atari800
You also need to install xasm (http://xasm.atari.org) to a directory on your PATH.


Building ASAP2WAV on Unix-like systems
--------------------------------------

You need Perl, Make and a C compiler.

From your shell prompt navigate to the "asap" directory (the one that
contains "asap.c").

If you got the sources from CVS, you additionally need the "autoconf"
package and must run the following commands first:
autoconf
autoheader

To compile and install, run the following commands:
./configure
make asap2wav
make install-asap2wav
The last command must be run with super-user priviledges.

If you have no super-user priviledges or want to install the program
in a non-standard location, you can specify the "--prefix" option
for the "configure" script, or simply copy the compiled program
instead of executing "make install-asap2wav".


Building the XMMS plugin on Unix-like systems
---------------------------------------------

In addition to the above prerequisites you need a full XMMS installation.
If you have just the XMMS binary package installed, you additionally need
"xmms-devel". I have tested only the 1.2.10 version of XMMS.
XMMS itself depends on Gtk+ and Glib, so you need them too.

To compile, run the following commands:
./configure
make asap-xmms

If the compilation finished successfully, you can install the plugin
in your home directory:
make install-user

or, if you are "root", for all users:
make install-xmms

If you have other XMMS plugins that support Atari 8-bit music, make sure
to remove them in order to avoid conflicts.


Building ASAP2WAV *and* the XMMS plugin on Unix-like systems
------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to compile and install both the converter and the XMMS plugin
for all users, there is a shortcut:
./configure
make
make install


Building ASAP2WAV, WASAP and the Winamp plugin on Windows
---------------------------------------------------------

You need a Microsoft C/C++ compiler, Windows Platform SDK and Perl.
I have tested only Visual C++ 2005 Express, Platform SDK for Windows
Server 2003 SP1 and ActivePerl 5.8.7.

You need to set "Path", "INCLUDE" and "LIB" environment variables
to point at the correct locations in VC++ and PSDK.
"perl" should be on the "Path", too.

From the command prompt navigate to the "win32" directory and run:
nmake

This will produce asap2wav.exe, wasap.exe and winamp\in_asap.dll.


Building the foobar2000 plugin on Windows
-----------------------------------------

You need the Windows compilation prerequisites (see above)
and foobar2000 0.8 SDK - extract it to a new directory called
"foobar2000_SDK" under the directory that contains "asap" and "atari800".

The following changes are needed to compile foobar2000_SDK\pfc
with Visual C++ 2005 Express:
