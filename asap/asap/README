ASAP - Another Slight Atari Player
----------------------------------

ASAP is a player/converter of Atari 8-bit music for modern computers.
It provides high-quality, identical to the popular Atari800 emulator,
emulation of the POKEY sound chip and the 6502 processor.

This release includes the following programs that use the ASAP engine:
* ASAP2WAV - portable command-line utility that generates WAV files
* WASAP - tiny player for Windows
* plugin for foobar2000 0.8
* plugin for Winamp
* plugin for XMMS

Currently supported input formats are:
* SAP (Slight Atari Player - standard file format for playing Atari 8-bit
  music on modern computers, samples are not supported yet)
* CMC (Chaos Music Composer)
* CMR (CMC Rzog - CMC with modified bass sounds)
* DMC (DoublePlay CMC - CMC with 6502 routines executed at double rate
  of the original CMC)
* MPT (Music ProTracker - without samples)
* MPD (MPT DoublePlay - MPT with 6502 routines executed at double rate
  of the original MPT)
* RMT (Raster Music Tracker)
* TMC (Theta Music Composer 1.x - 4-channel music)
* TM8 (Theta Music Composer 1.x - 8-channel music)
* TM2 (Theta Music Composer 2.x)

The biggest collection of SAP files is ASMA (Atari SAP Music Archive,
http://asma.atari.org). It is strongly recommended that you use ASMA 3.0
or newer. 226 files in ASMA 3.0 contain samples, the remaining 1780 can be
used with the current version of ASAP.

the TODO file before reporting a supposed bug (which may be really lack
of a feature) or submitting a feature request. Patches submitted
via the request tracker must be small and created against the current
