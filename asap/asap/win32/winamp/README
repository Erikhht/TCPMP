Another Slight Atari Player - Winamp plugin
-------------------------------------------

This is a plugin for Winamp that makes it possible to play Atari 8-bit music
stored in several formats. To install the plugin, simply extract in_asap.dll
to the "Plugins" directory of your Winamp installation. It is also recommended
that you remove other plugins that support Atari 8-bit music.

At the moment the plugin does not support multiple songs per file, seeking,
file information, configuration nor song lengths (you need to manually switch
between the files on the playlist).

This plugin is part of the ASAP project. Information about ASAP follows.
