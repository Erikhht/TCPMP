Another Slight Atari Player - foobar2000 plugin
-----------------------------------------------

This is a plugin for foobar 2000 version 0.8 that makes it possible to play
Atari 8-bit music stored in several formats. To install the plugin, simply
extract foo_asap.dll to the "components" directory of your foobar2000
installation (normally "C:\Program Files\foobar2000").

The plugin does support subsongs, which appear as separate items
on the playlist. foobar2000's default title formating doesn't include subsong
numbers however, so the subsongs look the same on the playlist.
To fix this problem, open Foobar2000 / Preferences / Display / Title formatting
and before the last line in the edit box insert something like this:
$ifgreater(%_subsong%,0, - subsong $add(1,%_subsong%),)
- this will add 1-based numbers to all subsongs except for subsong 1
(90% of SAPs in ASMA contain just one song). More advanced title formatting
(including total number of subsongs, AUTHOR/NAME tags, etc) will be possible
in future versions of ASAP.

The SAP file format supports definition of any of subsongs as the default
one (the one that should be played first from this SAP file). The plugin
puts the default subsong first on the playlist. However, by default,
foobar2000 sorts the subsongs itself. To prevent this (if you want to),
open Foobar2000 / Preferences / Core and clear the "Sort incoming files by"
field (do not worry about sorting by the path since subdirectories seem to be
traversed alphabetically anyway).

This plugin is part of the ASAP project. Information about ASAP follows.
