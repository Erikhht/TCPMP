WASAP - Windows Another Slight Atari Player
-------------------------------------------

WASAP is a tiny player of Atari 8-bit music for Windows. To install it,
simply extract the archive to a directory of your choice. WASAP is designed
to work on any version of Windows, starting with Windows 95.

When you run WASAP, an "Open file" dialog appears. Simply select the file
you want to listen to. Later, WASAP is controlled by its tray icon. When you
hover the mouse pointer over the icon, the name of the loaded file appears.
If the file contains several songs, the number of the currently playing song
and the number of songs in the file are shown.

To open another file, left-click the tray icon. The other options are
available with a right click on the icon. "RF" quality means POKEY sound
emulation programmed by Ron Fries. "MB" means Michael Borisov's emulation.

WASAP is part of the ASAP project. Information about ASAP follows.
