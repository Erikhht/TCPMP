Allocator override (speex_lib_ctl)
Support alloca/variable size arrays
Better error handling
Fixed-point:
  - Packet-loss concealment
  - Wideband
  - Initialization
  - Jitter buffer
Echo cancellation:
  - Re-enable denoiser hooks
  - Improve doubletalk detector
Denoiser:
  - Fix hyper-geometric approximation
  - Do some tuning
VAD-NG:
  - Use median filtering instead of "non-linear mean"



Features
-Add maximum/minimum bit-rate control for VBR
-Get the encoder to use the rate of packet loss (more conservative pitch gains)
-Improve error handling (with perror-like call?)

Long-term quality improvements
-Improve perceptual enhancement (including wideband)

Standards
-Complete Speex RTP profile
-MIME type registration

ideas:
Peelable stream (double codebook, higher bands, stereo)
LPC from spectral domain
Better psycho-acoustic model. Masking curve from Vorbis?
